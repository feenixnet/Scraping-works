# Hi. I am Roman from Upwork. I'd been doing scraping tasks for you. Unfortunately, my upwork account has been suspended for unknown reasons. I lost all the way to contact with you and that's why I am adding this to a readme file in the github repo. I really apologize for this. I think There has been build a trust between us big enough to continue work throughout my contribution to your project, although it is not good, and not that much. I am really looking forward to continue our collaboration. Could we restore contact and go on working? I'd be really grateful if you could do this. If you are interested, please contact through google chat or you could create your Slack channel and invite me. My email is nimbusabolt@gmail.com. Thanks.
